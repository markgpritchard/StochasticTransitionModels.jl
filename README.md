This package is mainly built for my own use. It allows generation of a stochastic continuous-time compartmental model.

The method is based on D. T. Gillespie, Exact stocastic simulation of coupled chemical reactions, _J Phys Chem_ *81*: 2340â€“2361 (1977).

Please see documentation for details of use.
